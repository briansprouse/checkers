This is a simple checkers game. Work is still in progress.

To build the application simply run 'make' and that will generate an executable
file called checkers.

The board game consists of an 8x8 grid with X's representing the computer and
O's representing the human player. To move one of your pieces you must type
the x-y coordinate of the piece you wish to move followed by the x-y 
cooridinate of where to move. These coordinates should be separated by spaces
or entered one value at a time. For example 3 6 2 5 would be a valid choice to
move the piece at 3,6 to the location 2,5. The x-y coordinate begins at the 
upper left-hand side at position 1,1.
